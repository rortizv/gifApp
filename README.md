# GifApp

This is my first React application.  A classic Gif search application that fetchs data from the Giphy API.

Go to https://developers.giphy.com/ create your account and get your own free api key.

Steps to run project:
- Clone the project
- Use Node +18
- Install node modules: npm i
- Run: npm run dev
